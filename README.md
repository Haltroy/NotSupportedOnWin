# NotSupportedOnWin

.NET project that is not supported on Windows.

Building requires .NET SDK 6.0 or newer (change the version in .csproj file), use `dotnet build` command to build it. Executables should be in `bin` folder.

### Q: Why?

idk funy

### Q: How? What type of code that you used to make it supported on everything else but not on Windows?

nothing lol it just checks if its windows then exits with error otherwise it should just report os version then exit.

### Q: i ran out of questions

dont hesitate to ask on discussions, issues or pull requests.

also all pull requests are welcome (except the ones which adds support to windows).
